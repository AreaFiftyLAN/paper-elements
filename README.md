# paper-elements v1 syntax

This repository hosts all paper-elements https://areafiftylan.nl uses, in v1 syntax.
At the moment, this is still work in progress.

**:warning: Do not submit Pull requests to this repository :warning:**
The effort of porting all elements to v1 syntax was a one-time action.
As such, we will only update this repository when our website requires an update.

If you want to update an element yourself, or add an element that was relying on a behavior, fork this repository and maintain the modifications yourself.
The Polymer team nor we are responsible for the maintainability of all the elements in v1 syntax.
The repository is therefore take it as-is.

TODO:

- [ ] Fix demos
- [ ] Integrate properly with our other bower components
- [ ] Move our paper element usage in lancie-frontend to this repository
- [ ] Publish `<iron-lazy-pages>` compatible version in this repository as well
